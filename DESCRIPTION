Description: Creating a great user interface for your Shiny apps
    can be a hassle, especially if you want to work purely in R
    and don't want to use, for instance HTML templates. This
    package adds support for a powerful UI library Fomantic UI -
    <http://fomantic-ui.com/> (before Semantic). It also supports
    universal UI input binding that works with various DOM elements.
