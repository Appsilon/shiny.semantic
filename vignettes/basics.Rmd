In this tutorial we will walk you through the basics of `shiny.semantic`. 

## Quick Q&A

First of all, let's answer a few questions:

- **Why do I need `shiny.semantic`?**

You can build your `Shiny` apps with standard shiny UI that relies on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
This means that `Shiny` attaches CSS and JS code that is responsible for its neat look.
However, after a while you might notice that all apps made this way tend to look quite similar.
`shiny.semantic` helps you to add a fresh look to your web application by providing an alternative
UI framework that works under the hood.

- **What `shiny.semantic` has to do with Fomantic UI?**

Similarly to `Shiny` attaching *Bootstrap* CSS and JS libraries, `shiny.semantic` relies on
[Fomantic UI](https://fomantic-ui.com/). Historically, we built this package around *Semantic UI*
library, but it got deprecated and now (since December 2019) we rely on the well-supported
and maintained community fork called [Fomantic UI](https://fomantic-ui.com/).

- **Do I need to learn a new syntax to be able to use it?**

Not at all! For your convenience, we created wrappers of the most popular functions
that you know from `Shiny`. For example, you can create an action button using a
snake case (which is a `shiny.semantic` standard): `action_button`, or
you can use, more familiar from `Shiny`, camel case with consistent parameters: `actionButton`.

**Note**, however, that the philosophy behind the *Bootstrap* and *Fomantic* is quite
different, so some behaviour might also differ. Usually `shiny.semantic` warns you or you
can learn more about it from documentation of a specific function.

- **Can I use standard Shiny components with `shiny.semantic`?**

It depends. In general, to be able to render `shiny.semantic` components correctly,
your app `UI` code must be surrounded by `semanticPage` (equivalent of `fluidPage`)
function that switches off standard Bootstrap dependencies. Thus some components from
Shiny might look just bad, but don't worry - most of them have `shiny.semantic` alternatives.
Having said that, all of standard HTML elements from Shiny should work just fine
(like `shiny::div` or `shiny::h2`).



## How to use `shiny.semantic`?

You can use `shiny.semantic` in two ways:

### (a) Using Fomantic CSS classes

If you know this and that about web development, you can create a number of components
by extending standard `Shiny` objects with class definitions from [Fomantic UI](https://fomantic-ui.com/)
documentation. For example:

```{r echo=T, include = T, eval = FALSE, screenshot.force = FALSE}
div(class = "ui raised segment",
  div(
    a(class="ui green ribbon label", "Link"),
    p("Lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum"),
    actionButton("button", "Click")
  )
)
```

```{r echo=F, include = T, screenshot.force = FALSE}
uirender(
  div(class = "ui raised segment",
    div(
      a(class="ui green ribbon label", "Link"),
      p("Lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum"),
      actionButton("button", "Click")
    )
  ),
width = "400px", height = "150px")
```


### (b) Using predefined objects

If you are not that comfortable with web development, you can take advantage of the 
number of elements that we implemented for you. See some examples below:

```{r echo = T, include = T, eval = FALSE, screenshot.force = FALSE}
range_input("range", 10, 15, 0, 20)
text_input("txt", type = "text", placeholder = "Enter Text")
date_input("date")
```

For more components visit our [Components live demo website](https://demo.appsilon.com/apps/semantic)
or the `examples/` folder on our [repository](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.semantic/).

Little sneak-peak of what you can get is listed on the graphics below. Most of the components
you may insert with just single line of code!

If you want to learn how to use a particular UI component, check its documentation. For example, you can call in RStudio (to see the docs for a counter button):

```{r echo = T, include = T, eval = FALSE, screenshot.force = FALSE}
?counter_button
```

or use our [documentation website](https://appsilon.github.io/shiny.semantic/).

All examples come with easy to use code snippets that will help you get started.
We hope that this short overview was useful. Good luck with building your first amazing
app with `shiny.semantic` :)
